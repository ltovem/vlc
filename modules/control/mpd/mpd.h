   directories in the music directory.
   The unique name is composed of the name of the directory, and if
   two entry points have the same directory name, a discriminatory path
   is appended with chevrons (slashes are replaced with pipes).

   Example: the user has two music directories with the same name,

   `music<file:|||home|user|music>' and `music<file:|||mnt|music>'.
